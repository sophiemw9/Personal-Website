            <p class="review">I enjoyed the coding worksheets and making the two websites as it was my first time using HTML and CSS. Having never coded a website before, it made the task more exciting as I had no insight into how each tag or design would affect the page. Therefore, when I refreshed the page and new changes were made, it helped the process of design feel more enjoyable. However, I did struggle to remember all the new tags and code as I felt as though I was learning too much too quickly. To help my understanding, I decided to look back on the worksheets I had already completed and wrote my own personal cheat sheet that explains how and when to use the different tags. This decision made designing my own website easier as I had notes to refer to that were written in a way that makes sense to me. The most difficult part of this task was understanding flexboxes and when to use them. I conducted further research to help my understanding of flexboxes and found one website that explained in detail the use of flexboxes (Comeau J, 2024). With my developed understanding I was then able to complete Coding Worksheet 4 as well as the following worksheets.
