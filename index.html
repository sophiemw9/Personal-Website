                    <p>For this task, I read through chapters 2-6 in “The Non-Designers Design Book” to develop my 
                        understanding in Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity within design. Using this 
                        knowledge, I had to create an A3 poster for each design principle using content provided.</p>

                    <p>For this task, I was given information to include about an exhibition in Bristol. Using 
                        this information, I needed to create 8 different posters each representing one of the 8 
                        typographic systems. The challenge outlined that we could only use 1 of the available 
                        typefaces, the canvas must be 200mm x 200mm. In addition to black, I could use only 1 
                        other colour and I may not include images/ illustration only shapes and lines.</p>

                   <h2>Coding Worksheets</h2>
                   <p>Each week, I was provided worksheets to work through to help develop my knowledge and 
                    understanding in HTML and CSS. I learnt the basics in setting up a website, to adding 
                    styles and design, to understanding flexbox. In addition, these worksheets gave me insight 
                    into using GitHub to host a website.</p>

            <h1>Review</h1>
            <p>This project has been fun to complete. Starting the first semester, I was very interested in 
                this module as I enjoy graphic design but have limited knowledge. Therefore, I was excited to 
                learn more and gain experience using the correct software. Before starting this course, I had 
                minor knowledge using InDesign and a vendetta against the software, since completing the CARP 
                task, and using InDesign more, it is growing on me and becoming more enjoyable. My prior knowledge 
                of Illustrator is much greater than that of InDesign, and a much more enjoyable experience. Since 
                I had used Illustrator a vast amount before starting the task, it helped as I was able to display 
                this knowledge within my work and further develop my designs.</p>
                
            <p>My plan behind my website was to create a minimalist, easily navigable website and to not draw focus 
                from my graphic design work. When deciding a colour scheme, I wanted to choose colours that represented 
                me as well as colours that didn't clash too much with my graphic design work. Creating this website
                was difficult as I had no prior knowledge about HTML or CSS. Completing the coding worksheets provided 
                lots of help as I gained basic knowledge to start creating my website from these worksheets. Whilst 
                completing the worksheets, I made notes about the different tags and styles, so I had references to 
                refer to that made sense to me and how I understand each element. This was very useful since my memory 
                was not on my side when remembering code. To extend my knowledge past these worksheets, I also referred 
                to w3schools and their tutorials to add elements to my website that goes beyond the most basics.</p>

            <p>Overall, I really enjoyed this project, from the graphic design to web development, I believe I have 
                gained lots of new knowledge as well as developed my prior knowledge. I am very happy with how my 
                website turned out and believe I completed all I had planned.</p>
