            <!-- Poster 1 -->
            <div class="poster">
                <img src="images/Contrast.jpg" alt="Contrast">
                <div class="poster-content">
                    <h2>Contrast</h2>
                    <p>Contrast within design is important to attract the reader to the design. 
                        The idea behind contrast is to avoid similar elements on the page, if they 
                        are not the same you must make them drastically different. To display this 
                        principle, I split the page in half following the design of the logo, although 
                        I flipped the white and red to be on opposite sides of the line to differ from 
                        the logo. By splitting the background and elements, I was able to easily display 
                        contrast on the page. </p>

            <!-- Poster 2 -->
            <div class="poster">
                <img src="images/alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment">
                <div class="poster-content">
                    <h2>Alignment</h2>
                    <p>The principle of alignment states that everything placed has a purpose and some 
                        visual connection with another element on the page. Within my design, the information 
                        about the event along with the website have been placed aligned along the left edge 
                        of the poster, whereas the date, location and title of the event have been placed 
                        aligned along the centre of the page. I have chosen to use two separate points of 
                        alignment to help navigate the readers eyes to the most vital information.</p>

            <!-- Poster 3 -->
            <div class="poster">
                <img src="images/Repetition.jpg" alt="Repetition">
                <div class="poster-content">
                    <h2>Repetition</h2>
                    <p>Repetition is the repeated use of elements including shapes, colours, fonts, 
                        textures, graphic content, textures, etc. This principle helps strengthen the 
                        unity throughout the page. For my design, I chose to repeat the polygon shape 
                        to make the background appear similar to a beehive. The placement of each letter 
                        within each shape, gives purpose to the polygons and helps connect the background 
                        to the foreground.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- Poster 4 -->
            <div class="poster">
                <img src="images/Proximity.jpg" alt="Proximity">
                <div class="poster-content">
                    <h2>Proximity</h2>
                    <p>The principle of proximity states that all related content should be close to each 
                        other to improve readability. These elements then become one visual unit rather than 
                        multiple separate ones. For my design, I kept the proximity of the general information 
                        close together. Since each part of information still belongs on its own line, the 
                        readability is still good. To separate the different elements, I added the film strips 
                        with old cinema photos.</p>
